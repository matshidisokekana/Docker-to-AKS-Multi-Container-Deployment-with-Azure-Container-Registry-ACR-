## üåê Project Purpose and Importance

### üîç Why This Project Matters

Kubernetes has become the industry standard for managing containerized applications at scale. Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) offers a **fully managed Kubernetes** solution that simplifies deploying, managing, and operating Kubernetes clusters in the cloud.

By completing this project:

* I **gained practical experience** deploying infrastructure in Azure using the Portal interface.
* I developed a deeper understanding of **cloud-native workloads**, container orchestration, and **DevOps practices**.
* It demonstrates my ability to set up **scalable, resilient environments** ready for real-world workloads and microservices.

## ‚úÖ Why Do We Need AKS?

* **Simplified Management**: Azure handles the Kubernetes control plane, reducing operational overhead.
* **Scalability**: AKS can scale your applications automatically based on load or predefined policies.
* **Cost Efficiency**: Only pay for agent nodes, not the control plane.
* **Security & Integration**: Built-in Azure AD support, RBAC, and integration with Azure Monitor and Defender for Cloud.
* **DevOps & CI/CD**: Easily connects with Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, and Helm for automated deployments.

Use cases:

* Hosting containerized web apps and microservices
* Big Data and ML workloads
* Development and test environments
* Event-driven applications (using message queues, etc.)

## üöß Challenges Faced

### 1. **Resource Group and Region Selection**

* Choosing the correct Azure region that supports all AKS features was crucial but confusing at first.

### 2. **Node Pool Configuration**

* Understanding VM sizing (Standard\_DS2\_v2, Standard\_B2s, etc.) and the cost implications took time.
* Learning how many nodes to deploy for performance testing was a bit of trial and error.

### 3. **Networking Options**

* Deciding between **basic networking** and **advanced (Azure CNI)** required research to understand the implications for IP ranges and connectivity.

### 4. **Authentication Setup**

* Setting up Azure AD integration and Service Principals was a bit tricky without CLI commands, especially from the Portal.

### 5. **Cluster Validation**

* It took a few attempts to properly configure `kubectl` via Azure CLI (`az aks get-credentials`) and test that the cluster was reachable.

### 6. **Cost Management**

* Since this was a test project, I had to be careful to delete the resources immediately to avoid charges.

## üéØ Key Takeaways

* Hands-on deployment helped bridge theory with practice.
* Realized the **power and flexibility of AKS**, but also the importance of **planning and security** in cloud environments.
* Highlighted areas to improve: automation (Bicep/Terraform), monitoring (Azure Monitor), and secure networking.
